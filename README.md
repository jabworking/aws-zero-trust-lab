# AWS Zero Trust Lab (Case Study)

## Overview
This case study explores how to implement Zero Trust principles in AWS using IAM roles, security groups, and centralized logging. The goal is to restrict access by identity, enforce least privilege, and track all access attempts in real-time.

Built entirely from iPad using GitHub Codespaces, AWS CLI, and CloudFormation.

## 🔒 Zero Trust Goals
- No implicit trust between components
- All access requires explicit identity verification
- Logs are centralized and queryable

## 🔧 What I Built
- VPC with private and public subnets
- Bastion host for controlled SSH access
- IAM roles with scoped permissions
- CloudWatch and S3 logging for all activity

## 🚧 Coming Soon
- Lambda-based alerting
- API Gateway + role-based access
- Visual dashboards for access monitoring

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
